# Heart Sync
Visualize your heartbeats and try to sync them with others! Heart Sync pictures the heartbeats of two people and encourages them to match their heart rates. Participants may also adjust the color of their pulse information to co-create the shared color field between them. Depending on their moods or personalities, it's either a calming, meditative moment or a playful, competitive game for two. More information here(TBA). (2017)
